# NASA Images

 - ### [Get Android APK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shamilkeheliya/NASA-MobileApp/main/NASA-Images.apk)


This free-and-open-source software product has been developed to easily access photos from the NASA image library through a mobile device running either iOS or Android Operating System. 

By leveraging the open-source UI software development kit of Flutter framework, a high-quality, natively-compiled, and null-safe codebase has been produced with flexible and prettified User Interfaces.

The very famous and extensive NASA image gallery houses captures of Earth, current missions, and those pertaining to astronomy.

In addition to accessing NASA library content from one searchable location, the application users can also hunt down resources by filtering the start and end year of the content being searched for. The user may also switch between light and dark modes, retrieve metadata associated with the capture(s) to content list view or single content view, and download content in fixed sizes and resolutions.

[Libraries I used](https://github.com/shamilkeheliya/NASA-MobileApp#libraries) are some noteworthy Flutter libraries at the forefront, being employed for the application implementation to facilitate important application functionalities.
